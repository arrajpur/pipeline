Pipeline to call DRIP peaks with stochhmm

1. ./normalize.pl input.wig normalized.wig
2. ./wig2fa.pl -i normalized.wig -o normalized.customfa
3. stochhmm -seq normalized.customfa -model DRIP.hmm -posterior -threshold 0.9 -gff > peaks.txt

StochHMM source: https://github.com/KorfLab/StochHMM

Warnings:

- wig must be variableStep format. 
- normalize.pl assumes span to be constant. 
- modifying DRIP.hmm or the convert() subroutine of wig2fa.pl will result in negatively affected peak calling!
- all scripts here were written for personal use and are very alpha. normalize.pl especially has no user validation. If something is not working right, please contact me!

Normalization:

Process implemented in normalize.pl:
- Linear median shift
  - Round all values
  - Throw away all values less than the third quartile.
  - Find median of the remaining values.
  - Divide DRIP median (10) that the model was trained on by the median of the input data to find the multiplication factor. 
  - Multiply every value in the wig file by the factor.
- Other normalization methods may be used instead, but this has been working well so far. wig2fa.pl assigns emissions based on wig signal height at the location, and was originally constructed for DRIP.
